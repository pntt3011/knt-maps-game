# Project for Android App Development course
Inspired by Pokemon Go, we develope an Android app in which users have to go to different landmarks, explore them and pass the challenges in order to check in at those places. 
With each captured place, user will get a number of scores, which is used to buy 3D model. The 3D models then can be placed in AR mode for other users to see.
